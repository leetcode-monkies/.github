# The Leetcode Monkey Community

## Description
The goal is to have an org where we can stay consistent with commits. And also get advice/help on leetcode solution. Outside perspectives are always great and help in our development!

## Workflow
- Create your own repo - please name it your github handle to make it easier
- As you work through problems to push, try to make branches for each problem
- Create PRs for others to view, and make sure to give a little blurb to solidify your understanding!

## Expectations
As much as other people are reviewing your code, do your part! Take a minute every so often to review other people's PRs
